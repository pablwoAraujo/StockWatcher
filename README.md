# StockWatcher

Initially you want the StockWatcher application to do six things.

- Provide users with the ability to add stocks. (Supply simple validation on input for illegal characters or existing stock.)
- Display the following information for each stock: symbol, price, change since last refresh.
- Provide users with the ability to delete a stock from the list.
- Refresh the stock price.
- Calculate the change since the last refresh as both a number and a percentage.
- Display a timestamp indicating the last update.
